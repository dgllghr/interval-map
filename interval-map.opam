synopsis: "An immutable interval map data structure"
description: """
An immutable interval map data structure implemented as an interval tree. Based
on [jgblight/im_interval_tree](https://github.com/jgblight/im_interval_tree).

Interval maps are great for finding intervals and their associated values which
overlap a given interval. This interval map supports intervals with excluded,
included, and unbounded bound ends. Multiple values may be associated with the
same interval.
